[1] Environment Variable

You must set the "PEGASUS_DRC" variable to point to this directory

Do this before starting Virtuoso:
 
% setenv PEGASUS_DRC {path}/Sky130_DRC_rev_0.0_2.8

You can also do this inside of Virtuoso with this CIW command:

setShellEnvVar("PEGASUS_DRC" "{path}/Sky130_DRC_rev_0.0_2.8")

[2] Primary DRC file

The top DRC file:  Sky130_DRC_rev_0.0_2.8/sky130_rev_0.0_2.8.drc.pvl

In the Pegausas DRC UI, go to Rules -> Tech&Rules -> Add... (on the right under "Rules")

[3] Configurator file

There is a configurator file to allow setting switches in the UI.

Configurator file:  Sky130_DRC_rev_0.0_2.8/sky130.drc.cfg

In the Pegausas DRC UI, go to Rules -> Configurator -> Input (... on the right for browser)

[4] Alternate SRAM Rules -- new in Version 0.0_2.8

DRC rule deck has an "Alternate SRAM Rules" switch which can be turned from the Configurator tab.
This switch will use the following alternate SRAM rules:
	- licon.4a:  licon in areaid.ce must overlap li1
	- licon.4b:  licon in areaid.ce must overlap (poly or diff or tap)
	- mcon.cover.1:  mcon in areaid.ce must overlap li1
** This is for debugging purposes only, errors may be missed. **

[5] Rule Groups

Groups are used to arrange rules by layer/type (M1, VIA2, etc.). 
You can see these in the UI by going to DRC Options -> Rule Selector
NOTE: when you load the configurator or change switches, 
  you will need to "Reload Rules" at the bottom of Rule Selector to update

[6] Frame Only Rules not implemented
