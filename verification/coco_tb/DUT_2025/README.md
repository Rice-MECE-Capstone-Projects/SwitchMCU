Make
gtkwave
iverilog


#### How to run rtl simulation
Make sure you have installed tools from above

"cd into rtl/riscv32i_module"
"make sim" --> generates vcd file
"make clean" --> to delete all files generated by sim (vcd, log etc)


to run Simulation
"gtkwave sim.vcd"


#### Files explained
params.vh    --> All paramters accross the design are defined here and none should be hard coded, all for decode and for size of wires should be declared here 
program.hex  --> This is the program memory that is loaded into instrtion memory 

assembly/program_disassembly.txt and assembly/instructions.log --> This is the instructions in assebly generagted by compiler but annotated to be human readable (NOTE the code does not start at address zero )

Makefile --> script which runs the i-verilog simulation, generates vcd and simulation file (these files are not uploaded into git)

riscv32i.v --> top level module which connects all mdoules together, should be where five stage pipline resigns

riscv32iTB.v       --> test bench which runs for a number of set cycles

all other .v files --> modules used in the main riscv32i.v



pc.v  --> program counter, 

ins_mem.v --> instruction memory, here the starting address of the code is places, ex: address 0x120
